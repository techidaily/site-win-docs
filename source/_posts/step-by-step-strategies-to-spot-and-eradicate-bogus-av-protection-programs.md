These are typically triggered by a [Trojan](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). More often than not, alerts from these malicious programs are quite aggressive possibly to overcompensate its ineffectiveness. Some fake antivirus actually infects computers during its installation. An increase of pop-ups and other alerts also come with the fake antivirus. The malware uses valuable system resources every time it creates a pop-up.

Typically, these websites will convince you to download more applications, enter your personal information, and even mimic other legitimate websites to gather more information about you.

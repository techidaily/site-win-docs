## Enable Native Popup Blocker Feature

All you need to do is to follow these simple steps:

1. First of all, you need to hit the “Settings” tab in order to take yourself to the Settings Section.[![Chrome Settings Menu](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Menu.png)](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Menu.png)
1. The “Settings” section appear.

2. Scroll to the very bottom where you could check out the “Advanced” tab. Click on it, and a number of advanced features will appear right in front of you.
3. A list of advanced features would be displayed right in front of you. Out of all of those advanced features, click on “Site Settings.”

6. Simply disable the allowed section and you are done.

Here, check if there are any websites mentioned in Allowed list. If you find something suspicious, delete those sites. In my case, I have kept one site in the allowed listing because it is my ISP and I trust them.

## Find Malicious Extension and Uninstall it

Another reason that the random pop-ups would annoy you might be the cause of the malicious extensions installed in the “Extensions” section of your Google Chrome.

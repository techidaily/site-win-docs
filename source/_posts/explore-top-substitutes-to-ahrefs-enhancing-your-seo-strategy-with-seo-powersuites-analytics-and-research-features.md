## 2\. Monitor Backlinks

Monitor Backlinks provides a focused solution for tracking and managing backlinks, essential for any SEO strategy. This tool offers detailed insights into your backlink profile, including new links, lost links, and the overall health of your backlink strategy. Additionally, it features a disavow tool, which helps users identify and disavow harmful backlinks that could negatively impact their site’s performance. The simplicity and effectiveness of Monitor Backlinks make it a go-to choice for those specifically focused on improving their link-building efforts.

However, while Monitor Backlinks excels in its primary function, it lacks some of the broader SEO capabilities found in Ahrefs. For instance, it does not provide keyword tools, competitor analysis features, or comprehensive organic traffic reports. This limitation means that while it can be a valuable addition to your SEO toolkit, it may not be sufficient as a standalone tool for all your SEO needs. Despite these shortcomings, Monitor Backlinks’ straightforward approach and reliable data make it a useful alternative for backlink management.

One of the key features of Serpstat is its comprehensive backlink dashboard, which provides detailed insights into your backlink profile, helping you understand the quality and quantity of links pointing to your site.

Despite its wide range of features, Serpstat’s data accuracy and depth have been points of contention among users. For instance, the keyword and organic ranking reports may not be as precise as those provided by Ahrefs. However, Serpstat’s extensive toolset, which also includes competitor analysis and rank tracking, makes it a versatile option for SEO professionals. Its ability to integrate multiple SEO tasks into a single platform can save time and improve efficiency, especially for those managing multiple websites or large-scale SEO campaigns.

Additionally, it supports social media campaign management across platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and LinkedIn. Raven’s integration with Looker Studio for data visualization and report creation makes it particularly useful for agencies needing to present detailed performance reports to clients.

One of Raven’s main advantages is its affordability compared to Ahrefs, making it accessible to smaller agencies and individual marketers. However, users have noted that the platform’s UI can appear outdated, and occasional glitches can disrupt workflow. Furthermore, the content on their blog has not been updated since 2021, suggesting that the tool may not be as actively maintained as some competitors. Despite these issues, Raven remains a cost-effective solution with a wide range of features for those looking to manage both SEO and social media marketing efforts.

### Pricing Plans:

![](https://www.link-assistant.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SpyFu--1024x341.jpg)

## 5\. SpyFu

SpyFu is a powerful PPC and SEO tool that excels in competitor research and analysis. It provides detailed reports that help users identify valuable keywords their competitors are using in both organic and paid searches. SpyFu’s robust set of tools includes keyword research, rank tracking, link-building suggestions, and SEO reporting. This makes it particularly useful for businesses looking to gain a competitive edge through comprehensive competitor insights.

Despite its strengths, SpyFu has limitations, particularly in the depth of its backlink analysis. The tool does not offer backlink audits, which can be a significant drawback for users focused on improving their backlink profiles. Additionally, it lacks search intent data, making it less suitable for large websites that require detailed keyword analysis. However, SpyFu’s affordability and its focus on competitor research make it a valuable alternative to Ahrefs, especially for smaller businesses and marketers with a limited budget.

### Pricing Plans:

#### Basic Plan

The Basic plan is available for $39 per month. It includes 10,000 search results and 10,000 data exports per month, along with 100 domain overview PDFs and access to six months of historical data.

![](https://www.link-assistant.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ubersuggest-1-1.png)

## 6\. Ubersuggest

Ubersuggest, created by Neil Patel, is a versatile SEO tool that provides a range of features, including keyword research, site audits, rank tracking, and backlink analysis. It offers an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced SEO professionals. Ubersuggest also includes a content ideas report, which helps users identify keyword opportunities and generate content strategies based on search intent.

While Ubersuggest is a strong tool, it is not as feature-rich as Ahrefs. Its primary strengths lie in keyword research and site audits, but it may not offer the same depth of data for more advanced SEO needs. Additionally, the tool’s free version is limited, and users may need to upgrade to access more comprehensive features. Despite these limitations, Ubersuggest remains an affordable and effective alternative for those looking to enhance their SEO efforts without breaking the bank.

### Pricing Plans:

#### Individual Plan

The Individual plan is priced at $12 per month, providing support for one website. It includes 150 searches per day, 125 tracked keywords per domain, and 5 competitors per domain. This plan is ideal for solo entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to improve their SEO performance affordably.

#### Business Plan

#### Lifetime Plans

The Individual lifetime plan costs $120, the Business lifetime plan costs $200, and the Enterprise lifetime plan costs $400\. These plans include all features of the monthly plans, making them a cost-effective option for long-term use.

### Pros:

![](https://www.link-assistant.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Keywords-Everywhere-1024x512.jpg)

## 7\. Keywords Everywhere

Keywords Everywhere is a unique browser extension designed for keyword research. It provides users with valuable keyword data directly within their web browser, making it a convenient tool for bloggers, content creators, and digital marketers. By simply entering a keyword into the search bar, users can receive search volume, CPC, and competition data instantly. This tool is particularly useful for on-the-go keyword analysis and quick SEO insights.

While Keywords Everywhere is handy for basic keyword research, it lacks the comprehensive feature set of tools like Ahrefs. The data provided is primarily sourced from Google, which may not be sufficient for users requiring detailed insights across multiple platforms. Additionally, it does not offer advanced SEO features like backlink analysis or site audits. Despite these limitations, Keywords Everywhere is an affordable and practical alternative for those needing quick keyword insights without the need for a full-fledged SEO tool.

### Pricing Plans:

#### Bronze Plan

The Bronze plan costs $72 billed annually, providing 400,000 credits per year. This plan supports up to 5 user seats and allows tracking of the top 2,000 keywords and backlinks per website. Additionally, subscribers gain access to SEO Minion, a useful tool for on-page SEO analysis, redirect checks, and more.

## Definition

Retention rate is a metric that measures the percentage of users or customers who continue to use a product or service over a given period of time[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). It is typically expressed as a percentage and can be calculated by dividing the number of users or customers who remain active over a given period of time by the total number of users or customers at the beginning of that period.

## Retention rate calculation

For example, if a company has 100 customers at the beginning of the month and 90 of them remain active at the end of the month, the company's retention rate for that month would be 90%.

## Improving retention rate

Retention rate is an important metric for businesses to track, as it can help to identify any issues or problems with a product or service that may be causing users or customers to stop using it. Improving retention rate can involve a variety of tactics, such as improving the quality of the product or service, providing better customer support, or addressing any issues that may be causing users or customers to leave.

There are several tactics that businesses can use to improve retention rate:

* **Improve the quality of the product or service:** Ensuring that the product or service being offered is of high quality can help to keep users or customers engaged and satisfied. This may involve regularly updating and improving the product or service, as well as addressing any issues or problems that may arise.
* **Provide excellent customer support:** Providing timely and helpful customer support can help to keep users or customers happy and satisfied with the product or service. This may involve having a dedicated customer support team, as well as providing multiple channels for customers to get in touch (such as email, phone, and social media).
* **Address any issues or problems that may be causing users or customers to leave:** If there are specific issues or problems that are causing users or customers to stop using the product or service, it is important to address these issues as quickly as possible in order to improve retention rate.
* **Offer incentives to keep users or customers engaged:** Offering incentives, such as discounts or rewards, can help to keep users or customers engaged and incentivize them to continue using the product or service.
* **Regularly communicate with users or customers:** Keeping in touch with users or customers on a regular basis can help to build a strong relationship and ensure that they feel valued. This may involve sending out newsletters or updates, or engaging with users or customers on social media.

## Benefits of a high retention rate

A high retention rate is generally considered to be good for a business, as it suggests that the majority of users or customers are satisfied with the product or service being offered and are continuing to use it. This can have several benefits for a business, including:

### Reduced customer acquisition costs

Acquiring new customers can be expensive, as it often involves marketing and advertising efforts. A high retention rate can help to reduce these costs, as it means that the business is retaining a large percentage of its existing customer base.

### Increased customer lifetime value

Customers who continue to use a product or service over a long period of time are likely to generate more revenue for the business than customers who only use it for a short time. A high retention rate can therefore increase the overall lifetime value of customers.

### Improved brand reputation

A high retention rate can also help to improve the reputation of a business, as it suggests that the company is offering a high-quality product or service that is meeting the needs of its customers. This can help to attract new customers and build trust in the brand.

### Increased profitability

Ultimately, a high retention rate can help to increase the profitability of a business, as it means that the company is retaining a large percentage of its customer base and generating a steady stream of revenue.

## Types of Android Malware

Malware is created to earn revenue. Cybercriminals use several methods to make money. They may not directly steal your money, but they track your data and sell those to earn money. Based on these methods, Android Malware is categorized.

### 1\. [Adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

Such malware disguises themselves as a legitimate app that has something to offer. When a user installs them in their phone, they start displaying ads. They could display ads as pop-ups, banner in the notification bar, the upper keyboard area, or in the browser. Some adware also redirects you other pages filled with lots of advertisements. The adware is also able to track your confidential information and act as spyware.

### 2\. [Spyware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

Spyware is same as the adware, in fact, adware could also be spyware. Such apps pretend to be a good application like a simple game or weather information app. Spyware tracks your sensitive information and sends it back to their makers. They could track your OS version, IMEI, IMSI, phone number, etc. Spyware could also track your browsing history. It could record your key taps and steal information like credit card number and login credentials.

### 3\. [Worm](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) & Trojans

Worms and Trojans can expand themselves and spread using the SMS and MMS. They could also use the syncing apps to infect other devices. Such apps start consuming your device resources and make your phone slow or sometimes could crash it. They could bombard SMSes to premium numbers and could increase your bill.

### 4\. Expander

Such apps exploit the feature of WAP billing. Hackers list a fake product on the WAP and such apps automatically purchase that product. You will see the charges in your bill. This way they earn money. Also, such applications could automatically send SMS and calls to the premium numbers that charge you.

### 5\. [Phishing](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) Apps

Like Phishing websites, phishing apps disguises itself as a popular app or service. They almost duplicate everything so that user consider them as the original app. When the user enters their login credentials in the app, it steals them. If you enter your credit card information in the app, it also takes them.

## How to Remove Malware from Android Smartphone?

Removing Malware from the Android is easy if you know about the guilty app. If you know which app contains the malware you can uninstall it. However, if you are unsure which app is causing the trouble, then you can follow the below steps-

### Clearing the Browser Cache: Your First Line of Defense

Imagine your web browser as the front door to your fascinating, yet overwhelming, internet world. However, just like your front door can sometimes invite unwanted guests, your browser can also be a gateway for malicious objects. This is where your cache, much like a doormat, comes in. It collects all the potential threats that aim to infiltrate your device. Clearing your cache is like shaking out this doormat, ensuring your device remains clean and secure. Here are the simple steps:

1. Navigate to the Settings on your device.
2. Tap on Apps and notifications.
3. Select the browser you use, for instance, Chrome.
4. Go to the Storage & cache menu, tap on Clear Cache.

Congratulations! Your browser is now free of potentially harmful temporary files.

### Safe Mode: The Cyber Security Equivalent of a Time Out

Don’t you sometimes wish you could pause the world and deal with one issue at a time? Safe mode provides that luxury. It’s a protective bubble where your operating system can function without interference from malicious apps. If your device is acting up – restarting on its own, freezing, or simply being slow, safe mode is your go-to solution.

To enter Safe mode, keep pressing the ‘Power Button’ until the prompt to start in safe mode appears. 

In case, you’ve configured Power button long press to open Voice assistant, pull down notification bar and tap the power button. Long tap the Power Off button

### Securing Your Google Account: A Password is Worth a Thousand Locks

Just as you’d change the locks after a break-in, it’s crucial to change your Google password if you suspect a malware intrusion. To strengthen your security further, enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This is akin to adding a deadbolt to your already sturdy front door, ensuring added safety.

![How to Remove Malware from Android](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Uninstall-App.jpg)

If you see the Uninstall option is greyed out or it is not there, then it means that the app has admin rights. Some apps that have malware get the admin rights to exploit the resources. They also do it so that users cannot remove them easily. However, it doesn’t mean that you cannot remove it.

To remove the admin rights. Go to **Settings** \> **Security & location** \> **Device admin apps**. Now tap on the **checkbox** and then tap on **Deactivate this device admin app**. Again go to the Apps & notifications to remove it.

## How to configure and use Automatic Updates

  
 Share this tutorial:

##  Introduction 

 Automatic updates allow to keep your Action! version always up to date without the need to download new versions manually. When new version is available Action! automatically downloads new installation files. When all installation files are downloaded it will inform you that new version is ready to be installed. 

 We strongly recommend to keep Action! always up to date as new versions may introduce important improvements for Action! functionality, including improvements for video recording, gameplay recording, Windows desktop recording, audio recording etc.

##  Action! settings

 Automatic updates require to enable **"Automatically check for updates"** option in Action! General Settings. Make sure that "Automatically check for updates" option is enabled.

## Discovering Covert Surveillance: A Step-by-Step Guide to Detecting Undercover Spyware on Your Android Device

Now, this might sound like something out of a spy movie, but it’s very real and very prevalent. [Report](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2020%5Fthe-number-of-new-malicious-files-detected-every-day-increases-by-52-to-360000-in-2020) suggest that cases of spyware infections have been on the rise, especially during the pandemic when our reliance on devices has increased tenfold. 

These apps are designed to be stealthy, meaning they won’t just pop up and say, “Hey, I’m spying on you!” However, there are a few tell-tale signs that could indicate your phone’s been compromised.   
  
**Fast-draining Battery**: If your phone’s battery life has suddenly plummeted, it could be an indication that a spying activity is running in the background.  
  
**Overheating**: Similarly, if your phone heats up even when you’re not using resource-intensive apps, a hidden spy app might be the culprit.  
  
**Increased Data Usage**: Spy apps need to send the information they collect back to the person spying. This can lead to a noticeable increase in your data usage.

### The Sneaky Power Drain: Decreased Battery Life

Ever noticed your Android phone’s battery draining faster than usual? No, it might not be because of your endless scrolling on social media or those binge-watch sessions. It could be a hidden spy app running in the background. These sneaky apps consume more power, as they are constantly active, tracking your activities, and transmitting information to a remote server. 

### Burning Up: Overheating of the Device

Another telltale sign of a hidden spy app is your phone heating up, even when it’s not in use. They are resource-intensive, requiring significant processing power to function. Your phone, acting as the unwilling host, may heat up as it tries to keep up with the app’s demands.

### Data Consumption Skyrocketing: The Red Flag

Are you running out of your data plan faster than usual? That might be more than just your latest Netflix obsession. Spy apps gather and send your data to a remote server or device, which can cause a sudden increase in data usage. If you notice an unexplained spike in your data consumption, it’s time to investigate.

### The Uninvited Eavesdropper: Unusual Background Noises During Calls

Ever heard strange noises or echoes during your calls? You might not be alone. Some commercial spyware apps can record your calls or listen in on your conversations using your phone’s microphone. If you’re hearing unexpected sounds during your calls, it could be a spy app eavesdropping.

### The Unwanted Slowdown: Slower Device Performance

Your device slowing down could be more than just a sign of aging. Spy app on your phone can hog your its memory and CPU, leading to slower performance. If you notice your device lagging or apps taking longer to load, it might be time to check for the presence of a android spy app.

### Digging Deep into Your Android Settings

Let’s kick things off by **diving into your phone settings**. You’d be surprised by how many secrets your phone keeps tucked away in there! If you’ve ever been curious about what’s lurking under the hood, now’s the time to explore.

There are several areas you can check for the signs. Have a look at your **app permissions, battery usage, and data usage**. Often, spy apps would need access to certain permissions, consume more battery life, and use more data than your regular apps.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Permission-Manager.webp "Permission-Manager")

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Not sure how to navigate your phone settings? No worries, we’ve got you covered. The steps may slightly vary based on your device model and Android version, but here’s a general guide:

1\. Go to “**Settings**“  
2\. Tap on “**Privacy”** and Select “**Permission Manager”**  
3\. Review each Permission and app.

Most importantly, look for apps having access to Camera, Location, Call logs and Microphone. These permissions pose more risk to your privacy. While reviewing, check whether any app has more than required permissions. For example: App called Smart Calculator having access to Call logs is a red flag. You must become suspicious about such behavior and remove app immediately.

Spy apps often come disguised under various unassuming names such as “System Update,” “WiFi Service,” among others. Keep an eye out for such apps.

### Look out for Device Admin Apps

Spy apps might take up administrative privileges to have greater control on your Android device. You can [follow these steps](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) to find if there is one:

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Device-Admin-Apps.webp "Device-Admin-Apps")

1. Go to the settings menu of your Android device.
2. Look for an option called “Security” or “Lock screen and security”.
3. Tap on “Device administrators” or “Administrators” to see a list of apps with administrative privileges.
4. Review the list of apps and make sure you recognize all the apps that have administrative access. If you find any suspicious app, you can disable or uninstall it.

### Deploy a Trusty Security App

Now, onto our next line of defense: a **security app**. They could be named as Anti-spyware, Anti-Malware or Anti-virus for Android.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Man-looking-at-Smartphone.webp "Man-looking-at-Smartphone")

A good security app works like a charm, scanning your phone for spyware and other types of malware. There’s a wide array of security apps available on Google Play Store, one of the reliable name is [TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

These apps are pretty straightforward to use. After installing your chosen security app, simply tap “**Scan**” or “**Check**” and let it work its magic to remove spyware.

### Sift Through Your App Drawer

Ever heard of the saying, “Out of sight, out of mind?” Well, that’s exactly what hidden spy apps bank on. They often sit quietly in your app drawer, away from your immediate view.

[What Viruses Actually Do to Your Phone?](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

Access your app drawer by tapping the circle icon with six dots on your home screen. Scroll through the list of third-party apps and keep an eye out for any unfamiliar or something installed without your knowledge.

Notice an app named “Smart Hide Calculator” or something similar? That could be a spy app in disguise! To verify, long-press the app icon until a small menu appears, tap the ‘i’ in a circle next to the pencil. That will give you more info about the app.

Additionally, you can check the Storage in use and Battery usage of that app from information page. If the numbers are unreasonably high, it’s time to get rid of it because it could be the hidden spyware. 

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/App-Permissions.webp "App-Permissions")

### Review App Permissions

Next up, let’s talk about app permissions. Spy apps need certain permissions to function. So, if you find an app with permissions that seem unnecessary for its function, that’s a red flag right there! A legitimate app will never ask for more than its requirement.

### Look for Unknown Apps

Unknown apps are often a breeding ground for spyware. Make it a habit to regularly review these apps and remove any unnecessary app from your android phone or tablet.

### Spot Unusual Location Symbols

Lastly, keep an eye on your notification bar for unusual **location symbols**. Spy apps often require location access, and if you see the location symbol pop up when you’re not using any location-based service, it could be a sign.

## How to Remove Hidden Spy Apps

Ever had that nagging feeling that your Android device is harboring an unwanted guest? If you nodded a ‘yes’, you’re not alone. But worry not, this guide will walk you through the process of evicting these digital intruders. 

### Uninstall Hidden Spy Phone Apps

2\. Scroll down to ‘Apps’: Here, you’ll see a list of all applications installed on your device.

4\. Tap on the app and hit ‘Uninstall’: Voila! You’ve just shown the door to the unwanted guest.

Remember, each Android device might have slight variations in these steps. But don’t panic. A quick Google search with your device model should guide you right.

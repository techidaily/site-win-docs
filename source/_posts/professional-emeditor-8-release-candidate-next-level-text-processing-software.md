EmEditor Professional 8.00 RC 1 is available for download. Updates from beta 12 include:  
 – Fixed the bug that the selection after regular expression find might be wrong when the “Additional Lines to Search for Regular Expressions” is set more than 0 in the Search tab of the Customize dialog box.  
 – Optimized the speed when a document contains Ext-B characters.  
 – The vertical scroll position fixed after wrap mode is changed.  
 See [http://www.emeditor.com/modules/feature1/](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/)  
 for updates from Version 7.  
 Download:  
[http://www.emeditor.com/modules/download2/](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) (Next Beta Version)  
 The portable version can be produced from the Import/Export wizard on the Tools menu after you use the installer. However, the portable version runs slower than one using the Registry.  
 We target the mid-November as the release date of v8\. Please let me know earlier rather than later if you have any bug reports or comments. Thanks!

I often search using the regular expression “^” only and replace with something like “no ” when i want to add “no ” in front of the lines. Starting with Beta 11 the first entry found then the “no ” isn’t added in front of the line, but after the first charater. The rest of the lines is replaced correctly.  
 So if i have 3 lines like this:  
 test  
 test  
 test  
 Then search for “^” and replace with “no ” then the result is like this:  
 tno est  
 no test  
 no test  
 I just installed rc1 and the problem is still present.  
 Regards
